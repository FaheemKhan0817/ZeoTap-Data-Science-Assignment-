![Clustering](cluster_visualization.png)

## 📊 Overview
This project implements advanced customer analytics, including customer segmentation and lookalike modeling, using transaction data from an e-commerce platform. The analysis helps identify distinct customer groups and find similar customers based on their purchasing behavior and preferences.

## 🚀 Features
- **Customer Segmentation**: Implemented K-means clustering to identify distinct customer groups
- **Lookalike Modeling**: Created a model to find similar customers based on multiple features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and patterns
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic plots and charts for better understanding of segments

## 📂 Project Structure
